# Post-Mortem

A post-mortem is a detailed analysis of an incident after it happens, aimed at understanding what went wrong and how to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## 1.1 What it is
A post-mortem is conducted to analyze an incident after it occurs, identifying root causes, response actions, and areas for improvement. This helps prevent recurrence by focusing on improving processes rather than assigning blame.

## 1.2 Key Elements of a Post-Mortem

1. **What happened?**  
   - Document the **incident timeline**, detailing each significant event from the start of the incident to its resolution.
  
2. **Why did it happen?**  
   - Conduct a **Root Cause Analysis** to uncover the underlying issues that led to the incident.

3. **How did we respond?**  
   - List the **actions taken** during the incident response, including any immediate fixes or workarounds.

4. **What can we improve?**  
   - Identify **preventative measures** and improvements to processes, tools, or monitoring that could help avoid similar issues in the future.

## 1.3 Example

If your website goes down for 2 hours, you would conduct a post-mortem to document the incident timeline, understand the root cause (e.g., a faulty update), and outline actions to prevent future occurrences (like improving testing processes).

## 1.4 Goal

The primary goal of a post-mortem is to learn from failures and prevent future incidents, focusing on process improvements instead of individual fault.

1. Embedded SRE
----------------
    1.1 What it is: 
        An SRE engineer working closely with a specific product 
        or development team to build reliability into their software.

    1.2 Why itâ€™s helpful: 
        Instead of a centralized SRE team supporting multiple services, 
        embedded SREs integrate directly with development teams to offer expertise and automate processes early.

    1.3 Example:
        An SRE assigned to a payment service team ensures that proper monitoring 
        and alerting are set up from the start, reducing operational issues later.

    1.4 Goal: 
        To bake reliability into the product development process from the beginning.


Summary:
----------------
Embedded SRE: 
    SREs directly work with product teams to build reliability from the start.

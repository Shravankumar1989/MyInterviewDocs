# Toil

**What it means:**  
Repetitive, manual work that keeps systems running but doesn't add lasting value.

**Examples:**
1. Restarting servers frequently.
2. Fixing alerts that could have been automated.
3. Manually deploying code every day.

**Goal:**  
SREs try to reduce toil by automating tasks, so they can focus on meaningful improvements rather than firefighting.

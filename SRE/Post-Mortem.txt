1.  Post-Mortem
----------------
    1.1 What it is: 
        A detailed analysis of an incident after it happens, to understand what went wrong 
        and how to prevent it from happening again.


    1.2 Key elements of a Post-Mortem:
        1.2.1   What happened? (Incident timeline)
        1.2.2   Why did it happen? (Root cause)
        1.2.3   How did we respond? (Actions taken)
        1.2.4   What can we improve? (Preventative measures)

    1.3 Example:
        If your website goes down for 2 hours, you conduct a post-mortem to document the incident, 
        understand the causes (e.g., a faulty update), and decide what actions to take (like improving testing processes).

    1.4 Goal: 
        To learn from failures and prevent future incidents 
        without blaming people (focus on processes, not individuals).

Summary:
----------------
    Post-Mortem: 
        A detailed analysis of an incident to prevent future problems.

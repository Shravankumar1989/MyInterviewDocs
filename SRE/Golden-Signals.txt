1. Golden Signals
----------------
    1.1 What it is: 
        Four key metrics that help monitor the health of a system.
        These are considered essential signals to spot issues early.

    1.2 The Golden Signals are:
        1.2.1   Latency – How fast or slow the system responds.
        1.2.2   Traffic – Volume of requests or demand on the system.
        1.2.3   Errors – Percentage of failed requests or operations.
        1.2.4   Saturation – How much of the system’s capacity is used (e.g., CPU, memory).

    1.3 Example:
        If latency increases and error rates rise, 
        it might indicate that the system is struggling to handle traffic.

    1.4 Goal: 
        To focus on the right metrics and ensure the service runs smoothly.

Summary:
----------------
    Golden Signals: 
        Four key metrics (latency, traffic, errors, and saturation) to monitor system health.

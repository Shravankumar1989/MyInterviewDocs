1.  Error Budget
----------------
    1.1 What it is: 
        A tolerance limit for failures. 
        Instead of demanding 100% uptime, an error budget defines how much downtime 
        or failure is acceptable over a period.
    
    1.2 Example:
        If your SLO is 99.95% uptime, that means you have an 
        error budget of 0.05% downtime (about 21.6 minutes per month).

    1.3 Why it matters:
        Teams can release new features more frequently without being afraid of minor outages. 
        But if the error budget is exhausted (too many issues), they need to stop new releases 
        and focus on fixing reliability problems.

    1.4 Goal: 
        To balance innovation and stability.


Summary:
----------------
    Error Budget: 
        The allowed amount of downtime or failure within a defined period, balancing reliability and innovation.

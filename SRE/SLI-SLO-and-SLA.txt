1.  SLI (Service Level Indicator)
---------------------------------
    What it means: 
        A metric that measures how well a service is performing.

    Examples:
        1.  Availability: Percentage of time the website is up (e.g., 99.9%).
        2.  Latency: How long it takes for a page to load (e.g., <200ms).
    
    Think of it as: 
        An indicator of how the system is doing, often collected through monitoring tools.


2.  SLO (Service Level Objective)
---------------------------------
    What it means: 
        A target or goal for the SLIs.

    Examples:
        1.  “We aim for 99.95% uptime each month.”
        2.  “Page load time should be under 100ms 95% of the time.”

    Think of it as: 
        A goal that tells you how well the service should perform.

3.  SLA (Service Level Agreement)
---------------------------------
    What it means: 
        A formal contract between a service provider and a customer. 
        It defines the service standards the provider promises to meet.

    Example:
        1.  "We guarantee 99.9% uptime. If downtime exceeds this, customers get a refund."

    Think of it as: 
        A commitment that the company makes to customers. 
        SLAs are legally binding, while SLOs are internal goals.


How They Connect:
---------------------------------
    1.  SLIs help you measure how a service is performing.
    2.  SLOs define what good performance looks like.
    3.  SLAs are promises to customers about service levels.

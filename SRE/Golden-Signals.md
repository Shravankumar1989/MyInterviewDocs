# Golden Signals

The Golden Signals are four key metrics used to monitor the health of a system. They are essential for spotting issues early and ensuring a system’s reliable operation.

## 1.1 What it is
Golden Signals consist of four critical metrics that provide insight into the system's performance and help identify potential problems.

## 1.2 The Golden Signals

1. **Latency**  
   - Measures how fast or slow the system responds. High latency may indicate performance issues.

2. **Traffic**  
   - Refers to the volume of requests or demand on the system. Spikes in traffic can stress the system.

3. **Errors**  
   - Tracks the percentage of failed requests or operations, which could signal malfunctions in the system.

4. **Saturation**  
   - Indicates how much of the system’s capacity is used (e.g., CPU, memory). High saturation levels can lead to slowdowns or failures.

## 1.3 Example

If latency increases and error rates rise, it may indicate that the system is struggling to handle traffic, possibly requiring investigation into resource saturation or capacity issues.

---

## 1.4 Goal

The primary goal of monitoring Golden Signals is to focus on the right metrics to ensure the service runs smoothly and identify potential problems before they escalate.

## Summary

**Golden Signals**:  
Four key metrics (latency, traffic, errors, and saturation) to monitor system health.

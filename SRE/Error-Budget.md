# Error Budget

An error budget defines an acceptable tolerance limit for system failures or downtime over a specific period. Rather than demanding 100% uptime, it allows for a small amount of downtime, giving teams a defined margin within which they can operate.

---

## 1.1 What it is
An error budget specifies the allowable amount of failure or downtime over a period, aligning with the Service Level Objective (SLO).

---

## 1.2 Example

If your SLO is 99.95% uptime, that means you have an error budget of 0.05% downtime, which equates to about 21.6 minutes per month.

---

## 1.3 Why it matters

With an error budget, teams can release new features more frequently without the fear of minor outages. However, if the error budget is exhausted (too many issues), teams must pause new releases and focus on addressing reliability concerns.

---

## 1.4 Goal

The goal of an error budget is to balance innovation and stability, allowing for continuous development while maintaining a reliable service.

---

## Summary

**Error Budget**:  
The allowed amount of downtime or failure within a defined period, balancing reliability and innovation.

# Embedded SRE

Embedded SRE involves assigning an SRE engineer to work closely with a specific product or development team to build reliability into their software from the beginning.

---

## 1.1 What it is
An embedded SRE works directly within a product or development team, integrating reliability practices and automation early in the development process.

---

## 1.2 Why it’s helpful

Unlike a centralized SRE team that supports multiple services, embedded SREs work directly with development teams, providing dedicated expertise and implementing reliable processes and automation early, which reduces operational issues down the line.

---

## 1.3 Example

An SRE assigned to a payment service team ensures that proper monitoring and alerting are set up from the start, which helps in minimizing potential operational issues as the service scales.

---

## 1.4 Goal

The main goal of embedded SRE is to incorporate reliability into the product development process from the outset, ensuring that reliability practices are part of the team’s daily work.

---

## Summary

**Embedded SRE**:  
SREs directly work with product teams to build reliability from the start.

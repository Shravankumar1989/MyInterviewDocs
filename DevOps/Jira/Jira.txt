what is the major issue will face while configuration Jira Software?
Performance-Related Issues:
1. Inadequate Resource Allocation:
    1.1 Cause: Jira Software requires a well-resourced environment, including sufficient memory (RAM), CPU power, and disk space. 
    If these resources are not adequately provisioned, Jira can become slow, unresponsive, or even crash under load.
    1.2 Impact: Poor performance can severely impact user experience, making the tool difficult to use for teams,
    leading to frustration and decreased productivity.
    1.3 Solution: Properly assess and allocate resources based on the size of your instance, number of users, and expected workload. 
    Regularly monitor performance metrics and scale resources as needed.
2. Database Configuration Issues:
    2.1 Cause: The database is the backbone of Jira, storing all its data. Misconfigurations, such as incorrect database settings,
    inadequate indexing, or insufficient database server resources, can lead to slow queries and overall sluggish performance.
    2.2 Impact: Database issues can lead to slow page loads, delays in issue creation and updates, and even data corruption in severe cases.
    2.3 Solution: Ensure the database is properly configured with the correct settings, and optimize queries by setting up appropriate indexes.
    Regular maintenance and monitoring of the database are crucial to prevent performance degradation.

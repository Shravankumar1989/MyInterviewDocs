# Ansible Project Structure

An organized structure is essential for maintaining clarity and scalability in an Ansible project. Here’s a typical Ansible project layout:

```
Ansible/
│
├── inventory/
│   └── vm-setup-playbook/
│       └── hosts               # Inventory file defining host groups and their IPs
│
├── roles/
│   └── python/                 # Role for Python installation or configuration
│       └── tasks/
│           └── main.yml        # Main tasks file for Python role
│
├── README.md                   # Documentation for the project setup and usage
│
└── vm-setup-playbook.yml       # Main playbook for setting up VMs
```

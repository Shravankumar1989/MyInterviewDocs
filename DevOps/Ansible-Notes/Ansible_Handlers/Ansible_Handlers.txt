What is Ansible Handlers?
An Ansible Handler is a special type of task within an Ansible playbook that is triggered
by notifications from other tasks

Note: Notify - Triggered by Notifications
Handlers are not executed automatically. Instead, they are invoked by other tasks that send a notification using the notify directive. 

Example
---
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Modify a configuration file
      template:
        src: config.j2
        dest: /etc/myapp/config.conf
      notify: Restart MyApp

  handlers: #Executed by Notify
    - name: Restart MyApp
      service:
        name: myapp
        state: restarted

1.  What is Veracode?
---------------------
    1.1 Veracode is a cloud-based application security platform that helps organizations secure their software by identifying, 
        fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities in applications. 
    
    1.2 It provides automated tools to scan source code, binaries, and web applications for potential security risks. 
    
    1.3 Veracode is widely used for 
        1.3.1 Static Application Security Testing (SAST), 
        1.3.2 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and 
        1.3.3 Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

2.  what are the Key features of Veracode include:
--------------------------------------------------
    2.1 Static Application Security Testing (SAST): 
        Veracode analyzes an application's source code or binaries without executing them. 
        It identifies coding issues like insecure code patterns, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities early
        in the development process.

    2.2 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): 
        Veracode performs black-box testing on running applications, simulating attacks and scanning for security vulnerabilities 
        such as authentication flaws or insecure configurations.

    2.3 Software Composition Analysis (SCA): 
        Veracode detects vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and third-party components that an application relies on, 
        helping developers ensure their dependencies are secure.

    2.4 Integration with CI/CD Pipelines: 
        Veracode can be integrated into continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines, 
        allowing security checks to be automated during the development process.

    2.5 Compliance Reporting: 
        Veracode provides detailed security reports and metrics, helping organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements 
        and maintain secure software development practices.

    Veracode is often used by development teams to ensure their applications are secure from development to deployment, 
    enabling secure DevOps practices (DevSecOps). It is popular among businesses looking to enhance their software security 
    posture without relying on purely manual code reviews or tests.

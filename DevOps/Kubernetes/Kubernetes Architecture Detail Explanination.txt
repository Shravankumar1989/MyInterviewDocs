What is kubernetes?
-------------------
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tools 
for deploying, scaling, and managing automated applications.


Kubernetes Architecture
----------------------------

1. KubeCtl
2. API Server
3. Controller Manager
4. ETCD
5. Kube-Scheduler
6. Node
      - Kubelet
      - kube-proxy
      - Pod
      - Container Runtime Engine


Note: 

point 2,3,4,5 - is a master node
point 6 - is a worker node

1. KubeCtl - Kubectl is the default interface Tool between the user and cluster.

2. API Server - API Server is component through which the user interact with the control plane.  

3. Controller Manager - Reponsible managing all the contollers in the cluster
ex. Replication controller, Node controller, Endpoint controller, Token controller 

4. ETCD - All the cluster data is stored in key-value store called ETCD.

5. Kube-Scheduler - Kube-Scheduler is a control plane process which assigns Pods to Nodes

6. Node - Node is a worker machine in a cluster

      - Kubelet = Kubelet is a Kuberbetes agent that manages the node

      			  and Ensure all the pods are running and healthy

      - Kube-proxy = Kube-proxy manage all the network traffic on the node

      - Container Runtime Engine = Container Runtime Engine is responsible for running containers on the cluster

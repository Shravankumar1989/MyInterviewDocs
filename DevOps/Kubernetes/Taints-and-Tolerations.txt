1.  what is Taint and Toleration?
---------------------------------
    which pods can be scheduled on which nodes.

    rememeber:
    ----------
    Taint - For Node Level
    Toleration - For Pod Level

2.  Common Effects for Taints
-----------------------------
    2.1 NoSchedule: 
        Prevents pods from being scheduled unless they tolerate the taint.

    2.2 PreferNoSchedule: 
        Scheduler tries to avoid placing pods on this node but will if necessary.
        or 
        which means the system will try to avoid placing a pod on the node,
        but that is not guaranteed

    2.3 NoExecute: 
        Existing pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted, and new pods are not scheduled.

3. Commands for Taint and Toleration?
-------------------------------------
    3.1     Apply Taint to a Node
            kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>

            example:-
            kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
    
    3.2     Remove Taint from a Node
            To remove a taint from a node, use a hyphen (-) at the end of the taint specification:
            kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>:<effect>-

            example:-
            kubectl taint nodes node1 app:NoSchedule-
    
    3.3     List Taints on a Node
            kubectl describe node <node-name>

            example:-
            kubectl describe node node1

    3.4     Add Toleration to a Pod

            example:-

            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Pod
            metadata:
              name: mypod
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nginx
                image: nginx
              tolerations:
              - key: "app"
                operator: "Equal"
                value: "blue"
                effect: "NoSchedule"

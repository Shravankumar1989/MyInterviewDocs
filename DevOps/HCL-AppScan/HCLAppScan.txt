Procedure
1. In Jenkins, install the HCL AppScan plug-in:
    1.1 Select Manage Jenkins and then Manage Plugins.
    1.2 Select the Available tab and then select the check box next to HCL AppScan.
    1.3 Click one of the installation buttons at the bottom of the page. 
        After installing the HCL AppScan plug-in, you must restart Jenkins before using it. 
        However, you may want to install it and then restart Jenkins later (for example, if you have running jobs).
    
    Note: Depending on the version of Jenkins that you are running, these steps may vary slightly.

2. After restarting Jenkins, add credentials so that your build project can connect to AppScan on Cloud:
    2.1 In the Jenkins dashboard, select Credentials.
    2.2 In the Credentials page, add new global credentials. 
        To do this, select the arrow icon next to the (global) link and then select Add credentials.
    2.3 In the credentials page, select HCL AppScan on Cloud Credentials in the Kind list.
    2.4 Specify an AppScan on Cloud server URL for the connection. By default, the URL is https://cloud.appscan.com.
    2.5 When you generate an API key in the AppScan on Cloud service, you receive a Key Id and Key Secret. 
        Enter these values in the ID and Secret fields. If you have not yet generated an API key, follow the link for creating one.
    2.6 Optional: Use the Label field to add an identifier for the credentials.

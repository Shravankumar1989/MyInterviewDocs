# Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Interview Preparation

## SRE Core Competencies

### 1. Incident Management and Troubleshooting
- **Question:**: How do you approach incident management and troubleshooting?
  - **Answer:**: I follow a structured approach, starting with identifying the root cause and assessing impact. Using monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, I gather real-time data to diagnose issues. I also have a pre-established incident response plan, which includes notifying stakeholders and documenting steps for transparency and learning.

- **Question:**: Can you share an example of a major incident you handled?
  - **Answer:**: In a previous role, we faced an unexpected production outage due to high CPU usage. I quickly isolated the affected services using real-time metrics and logs. After mitigating the immediate issue, I worked on a long-term fix to optimize CPU usage and added custom alerts for early detection.

### 2. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Question:**: What monitoring and alerting tools do you use, and how do you set up effective alerts?
  - **Answer:**: I primarily use Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization. I set up alerting rules based on critical metrics such as latency, error rates, and resource utilization. To avoid alert fatigue, I fine-tune thresholds and use dynamic alerting based on baseline metrics.

- **Question:**: Describe a time when monitoring helped prevent an issue.
  - **Answer:**: In one case, I set up alerts for memory usage across a microservices architecture. We received early warnings about high memory consumption, allowing us to address memory leaks in specific services before they impacted performance in production.

### 3. Reliability Engineering and SLA/SLO/SLI
- **Question:**: How do you define and manage SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs?
  - **Answer:**: I start by understanding business requirements and setting realistic SLAs with stakeholders. SLOs are defined for internal goals, focusing on metrics like uptime, response time, and error rates. SLIs are calculated directly from these metrics, and I monitor them regularly, using tools to track compliance and adjust thresholds when necessary.

- **Question:**: How do you ensure uptime and reliability?
  - **Answer:**: I ensure redundancy in system design and implement autoscaling and failover mechanisms. Regularly testing backup systems, performing load testing, and using chaos engineering practices help me proactively address potential weaknesses in the system.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Automation
- **Question:**: How do you use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to improve reliability?
  - **Answer:**: IaC allows me to automate environment provisioning, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency. I use Terraform to define and manage infrastructure, allowing for version control and repeatable deployments. This approach also enables quick rollbacks and disaster recovery.

- **Question:**: Can you give an example of automation that improved system reliability?
  - **Answer:**: I automated health checks and deployments using Jenkins and Terraform, allowing us to detect and resolve issues without manual intervention. By setting up automated rollbacks for failed deployments, we reduced downtime and ensured faster recovery times.

### 5. Capacity Planning and Performance Optimization
- **Question:**: What’s your approach to capacity planning?
  - **Answer:**: I analyze historical usage data, assess growth trends, and factor in future business projections. Using these insights, I establish scaling policies and set up alerts to anticipate resource shortages before they impact performance.

- **Question:**: How do you optimize performance in a large-scale distributed system?
  - **Answer:**: I optimize by identifying bottlenecks through profiling and monitoring. For instance, I’ve used load balancing to distribute traffic evenly and configured autoscaling policies to handle peak loads. Optimizing query performance and caching frequently accessed data are also part of my optimization strategy.

## SRE Behavioral Skills

### 1. Collaboration and Communication
- **Question:**: How do you collaborate with developers, QA, and other stakeholders?
  - **Answer:**: I hold regular sync meetings to discuss system performance and reliability goals. I also provide clear documentation and postmortem reports after incidents to ensure shared understanding and continuous improvement across teams.

- **Question:**: How do you handle situations where a service isn’t meeting its SLO?
  - **Answer:**: I prioritize transparency with stakeholders, providing data on the service’s performance and discussing options for improvement. I analyze the root cause and implement fixes or optimizations, keeping the team informed throughout.

### 2. Knowledge Sharing and Continuous Improvement
- **Question:**: How do you share best practices with your team and contribute to continuous improvement?
  - **Answer:**: I conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions on tools, monitoring techniques, and SRE best practices. I also contribute to postmortems, documenting key takeaways and preventative measures, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

### 3. Adaptability and Problem-Solving
- **Question:**: How do you handle high-pressure situations, like a major production issue?
  - **Answer:**: I stay calm and focus on resolving the issue methodically. I start with immediate containment, then work to isolate and resolve the problem. Communication with the team is essential, ensuring they’re informed of progress and next steps. After resolution, I review the incident to identify improvement areas.

## Technical Tools and Technologies

### 1. Jenkins
- **Question:**: How have you used Jenkins in SRE practices?
  - **Answer:**: I use Jenkins to automate repetitive tasks, such as building and deploying code, and for automated testing in staging environments. Jenkins helps ensure consistent deployment processes, reducing manual errors and allowing for quick rollbacks in case of issues.

### 2. Kubernetes
- **Question:**: How do you manage Kubernetes clusters for reliability?
  - **Answer:**: I set up health checks, configure autoscaling, and ensure redundancy in deployments. I monitor cluster metrics and use pod disruption budgets to maintain service availability during upgrades or maintenance.

### 3. Prometheus and Grafana
- **Question:**: What is your approach to setting up monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana?
  - **Answer:**: I define key metrics related to system performance and user experience, such as latency, error rates, and resource utilization. I create Grafana dashboards for visibility and set up Prometheus alerts to notify us when metrics exceed defined thresholds, allowing us to proactively address potential issues.

## Sample Scenario-Based Answers

1. **Scenario 1**: **A critical production service is down, and multiple teams are involved in the resolution. How do you handle the situation?**
   - **Answer:**: I immediately organize a war room to bring the relevant teams together. I assign roles to streamline responsibilities, such as someone monitoring metrics, someone communicating with stakeholders, and others focusing on specific areas. I document the steps taken for a postmortem review to prevent future incidents.

2. **Scenario 2**: **A system shows increased latency, impacting user experience. How do you diagnose and resolve the issue?**
   - **Answer:**: I first check monitoring tools to pinpoint latency sources, such as database queries or API requests. Using distributed tracing, I identify bottlenecks and address them by optimizing queries, increasing caching, or balancing traffic.

3. **Scenario 3**: **You need to onboard a high-traffic application to a new infrastructure. Describe your approach.**
   - **Answer:**: I start with a capacity assessment to ensure the infrastructure can handle peak loads. I then set up staging environments to test configurations and gradually onboard the application, using blue-green deployment or canary releases to minimize risks and monitor performance.

4. **Scenario 4**: **A team member is unfamiliar with monitoring tools. How do you help them?**
   - **Answer:**: I provide an overview of the tools we use, explaining the key metrics and alerts. I demonstrate how to create dashboards and respond to alerts, ensuring they have a foundational understanding and feel comfortable using the tools independently.

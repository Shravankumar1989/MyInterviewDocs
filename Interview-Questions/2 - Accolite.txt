AWS EKS & Kubernetes:
1.	Describe how you would set up a Kubernetes cluster from scratch on AWS EKS.
    o	Follow-up: What considerations do you have for VPC design and availability zones?
2.	How would you provision and manage node groups in AWS EKS?
    o	Follow-up: Have you worked with Fargate, and how does it differ from managing node groups manually?
3.	Walk me through the setup of an application in AWS EKS using an Ingress Controller and ALB.
    o	Follow-up: How would you configure Route 53 with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and integrate a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?
Scaling and Auto-scaling:
4.	What strategies have you used for scaling Kubernetes pods in a cluster?
    o	Follow-up: Can you explain how Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) works and when it would be necessary to implement it?
5.	How do you configure and manage auto-scaling of node groups in AWS EKS?
    o	Follow-up: Have you worked with any other tools, such as Carpenter, for node auto-scaling?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
6.	How do you manage multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod) in Terraform for infrastructure automation?
    o	Follow-up: Can you describe how Terraform workspaces work in your current environment?
7.	How would you integrate IAM roles and policies for EKS services and workloads in your setup?
Argo CD & CI/CD:
8.	How have you used Argo CD to manage deployments in AWS EKS?
    o	Follow-up: Can you explain how Argo CD synchronizes your GitHub repository with your Kubernetes clusters?
9.	What branching strategy have you implemented to ensure the right code is deployed to the correct environment using Argo CD?
10.	What benefits do Helm charts offer in Kubernetes, and how have you used Helm in your deployment pipelines?
    o	Follow-up: How do you perform rollbacks using Helm?
Monitoring & Security:
11.	What tools have you used for monitoring Kubernetes clusters?
    o	Follow-up: What kind of metrics do you monitor in Prometheus and Grafana, and how does this data help you manage the health of the cluster?
12.	How do you secure communication between AWS EKS and other AWS services like S3 or RDS?
13.	What role does Network Policy and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) play in your Kubernetes deployments?
Miscellaneous & Concepts:
14.	Have you worked with tools like Crossplane or Carpenter for infrastructure and Kubernetes management?
    o	Follow-up: How would you handle a scenario if you were asked to integrate Carpenter or Crossplane in your environment?
15.	Can you explain a scenario where you faced a scaling issue and how you resolved it using Kubernetes and EKS?
16.	How does your experience with AWS Solution Architect certification help you in setting up and managing cloud-native applications?
These questions cover a broad range of technical areas from the conversation and would allow you to gauge a candidate's depth of experience in AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, scaling, and IaC.
